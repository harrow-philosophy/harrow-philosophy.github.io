# The Law
Notes on "The Law" by Frederic Bastiat
## Purpose
- To protect Life, Liberty, and Property
- The purpose of the law is to prevent injustice from reigning.
   Not "To cause justice to reign.
   Justice is only achieved when injustice is absent

## Law Perverted
"...to limiting and destroying rights which its real purpose was to respect."
"It has converted plunder into a right, in order to protect plunder. And it has converted lawful defense into a crime, in order to punish lawful defense."
- Did not see that the state requires such a contradiction.

"Nothing can enter the public treasury for the benefit of one citizen or one class unless other citizens and other classes have been _forced_ to send it in."

"...every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all."

May argue that liberty is the act of a man having the power to use and develop their faculties then it follows the state must provide what is necessary for that in order to ensure liberty. This begs the question, by what means is the state to grant this use over ones faculties? By restricting the use of another to their faculties of course!

As the power of government grows so to does its responsibility. 
- It intends to create a monopoly on education in exchange for liberty. Should it fail who is to blame?
- More often than not the solutions to these shortcomings involve an expansion rather than a reduction in the size of government.
- Eventually the government cannot do what it sought to and revolution follows, to be replaced by a government claiming it can.

## Definitions:

Law: the common force organized to act as an obstacle to injustice.
- Law is Justice.
 
Origin of Property: A man living and satisfying his wants by the ceaseless application of [man's] faculties to natural resources.

Origin of Plunder: a man living and satisfying his wants by seizing and consuming the products of the labor of others.


Socialism = Legal Plunder
- Legal Plunder: The plunder of property by means of legislation, ie. State plunder.

## Plunder
-Plunder: When a portion of wealth is transferred from the person who owns it--without his consent and without compensation, and whether by force or by fraud--to anyone who does not own it.

* Without compensation is not a necessary requirement for plunder. Eminent Domain requires "just compensation," but the crucial point is that it is without consent.

The person who receives the benefits of plunder is not responsible for the act of plundering. The responsibility lies with those who enact the legal plunder legislation and carry it out.

## Recognition
Identify by examining if a legislation grants the state the power to act "non-criminally" in a way that would be criminal for a citizen to act.
 - Taxation or Eminent Domain

Socialism is a result of the trend in classical thought that man is inert and tends towards degeneration, and must be shaped by legislators to save them from themselves.
- Hobbes' "nasty, brutish, and short"
- Rousseau argued that 'writers' must legislate every aspect of man's life, as if man couldn't know how to plant a seed if not legislated on it. How then do the writers know? Are they not man? They fancy themselves as gods.

## Collectivism as anti-man

These "Democrats" proclaim philanthropy but treat man no better than mud. Man is to be shaped and molded. They are too stupid, too ignorant, too immoral to lead themselves and therefore, must be led, by compulsion. They may not be so bold as to proclaim themselves to be the rulers of these people, yet they certainly treat themselves as some exception to this rule, and pass judgement at the very least, of what the legislator ought to do.

Superman: They idea that the legislator is able to divert man from their destructive tendencies, requires the idea that they are in some way an exception to the rule. This is evident all the way from Plato's Myth of the Metals. This supposed superiority has yet to be substantiated.
- despite being incompetent and determined to choose poorly for themselves, they _must_ be granted suffrage, free of coercion.

## Remedies

Should the law simply be to protect liberty then the government (granting there is one) would not be to blame for any inequalities that arise. 

The faculties of reason within man must develop through the possession of liberty.

Reject the whims of the legislators and governmental administrators! Embrace Liberty!

# The Law
Notes on "The Law" by Frederic Bastiat
## Purpose
- To protect Life, Liberty, and Property
- The purpose of the law is to prevent injustice from reigning.
   Not "To cause justice to reign.
   Justice only achieved when injustice is absent

## Law Perverted
"...to limiting and destroying rights which its real purpose was to respect."
"It has converted plunder into a right, in order to protect plunder. And it has converted lawful defense into a crime, in order to punish lawful defense."
- Did not see that the state requires such a contradiction.

"Nothing can enter the public treasury for the benefit of one citizen or one class unless other citizens and other classes have been _forced_ to send it in."

"...every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all."



## Definitions:
 - Origin of Property: A man living and satisfying his wants by the ceaseless application of [man's] faculties to natural resources.

- Origin of Plunder: a man living and satisfying his wants by seizing and consuming the products of the labor of others.


Socialism = Legal Plunder
- Legal Plunder: The plunder of property by means of legislation, ie. State plunder.

## Recognition
Identify by examining if a legislation grants the state the power to act "non-criminally" in a way that would be criminal for a citizen to act.
 - Taxation or Eminent Domain

Socialism is a result of the trend in classical thought that man is inert and tends towards degeneration, and must be shaped by legislators.
- Hobbes' "nasty, brutish, and short"
- Rousseau that 'writers' must legislate every aspect of man's life, as if man couldn't know how to plant a seed if not legislated on it. How then do the writers know? Are they not man? They fancy themselves as gods.

## Plunder
-Plunder: When a portion of wealth is transferred from the person who owns it--without his consent and without compensation, and whether by force or by fraud--to anyone who does not own it.



* Without compensation is not a necessary requirement for plunder. Eminent Domain requires "just compensation," but the crucial point is that it is without consent.

The person who receives the benefits of plunder is not responsible for the act of plundering. The responsibility lies with those who enact the legal plunder legislation and carry it out.

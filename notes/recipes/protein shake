#+TITLE: Steps for the best protein shake
Ingredients:
1 cup of oats
2 scoops of chocolate whey protein powder
2 tablespoons of peanut butter
1 tbs of honey
1 banana
sprinkle of cinnamon
1 tbs olive oil
1 handful of ice
1 to 1 1/3 cups of milk

Steps:
Add the oats by themselves to the blender and blend into a powder - blending when dry prevents oat clumping
Add protein powder
Add cinnamon
Add the banana and break it by hand into smaller pieces for easy fitting
Add the peanut butter
Add the honey
Add the ice
Add olive oil
Add milk - do this last as the milk sitting will make the powders stick to the walls
Blend immediately after adding milk

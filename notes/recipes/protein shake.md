# Steps for the best protein shake

## Ingredients:
- 1 cup of oats
- 2 scoops of chocolate whey protein powder
- 2 tablespoons of peanut butter
- 1 tbs of honey
- 1 banana
- sprinkle of cinnamon
- 1 tbs olive oil
- 1 handful of ice
- 1 to 1 1/3 cups of milk

## Steps:
1. Add the oats by themselves to the blender and blend into a powder - blending when dry prevents oat clumping
2. Add protein powder
3. Add cinnamon
4. Add the banana and break it by hand into smaller pieces for easy fitting
5. Add the peanut butter
6. Add the honey
7. Add the ice
8. Add olive oil

# On volitional action

Shashan has proposed to me a problem which suggests determinism and he claims this sticking point is what prevents him from accepting a theory of free will.
## The problem
To prove we are in full control of our desires, our desires inform our highest preferences.
If desires are determined, then preferences are determined, so actions are determined.
(Already adopts the action axiom in that action is a selection of ones highest preference based on ordinal ranking)

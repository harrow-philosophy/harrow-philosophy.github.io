In the public property and open boarders debate amongst Libertarians the point of contention is the ownership status of public property. Three alternative answers are porposed.
1. The public property is unonwned.
2. The public property is group owned.
3. The public property is owned by some individual.

Public property is defined as land, buildings, or assets claimed by the government or some other state like entity. This can range from a public school bus to the pentagon building.

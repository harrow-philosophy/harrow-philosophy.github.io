# "The Universalizability of Argumentation Ethics" by Eliot Kalinov

## Aim
The aim of this paper was to defend argumentation ethics on its universalizability principle, while allowing arguments against the specific norms that may be presupposed in argumentation to go by.

## A lesson on hierarchy
This paper is an opportunity to review the hierarchy of philosophy. Argumentation ethics requires saying "existence exists, and is primary to consciousness, and the senses are valid, and man's consciousness is volitional, and moral realism is true, and xyz, and  argumentation ethics is true. It is valid to attack argumentation ethics directly or any of the philosophical foundations from which it stands; thus, the importance of a philosophical foundation is demonstrated. One cannot validate argumentation ethics if they are not first able to validate action as an axiom, and everything else that is necessary.
